Histograms look at a single set of data.  Many people think of histograms as a bar graph- that deal quantitative data.

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)

```

For an example we'll create a histogram using all bodyweights of all baseball players.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT weight 
FROM Master"

result<-sqldf(query)
```
Now that we've selected our data we're going to make it into a histogram.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="blue",fill="white",bins=50)+
  ggtitle("Baseball Player Bodyweights")+
  xlab("Weight of Player")+
  ylab("Number of Players")
```
