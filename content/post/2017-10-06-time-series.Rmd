```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)

```
Now we'll plot a Time Series Chart (which is two sets of data compared to each other but one set of data is time):

```{r}
query<-"SELECT HR,yearID 
FROM Batting
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"
result<-sqldf(query)
```

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle("Babe Ruth's Homeruns Over The Span of His Career")+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Number of Homeruns")

  


```
