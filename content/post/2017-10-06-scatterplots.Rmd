```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)

```

Welcome to my very first post regarding data science!  Let's start the ball rolling with a look at Scatterplots:
```{r}
query<-"SELECT sum(HR) as careerHR, sum(SO) as careerSO 
FROM Batting 
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(HR)>400"

result<-sqldf(query)
```

So excited, in the line above we're looking at the extracted data!

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=careerSO,y=careerHR),size=4)+
  ggtitle("Career Strikeouts and Career Homeruns")+
  xlab("Career Strikeouts")+
  ylab("Career Homeruns")

```
